# Portfolio

A playful, pixelated portfolio site built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, NES.css, and Framer Motion. This project transforms your professional work experience and open-source projects into an interactive, retro-inspired experience with smooth animations and light/dark themes.

## 🚀 Features

- **Light & Dark Mode**: Automatically detects user timezone for day/night and allows manual toggle.
- **Minecraft Aesthetic**: Blocky gradients emulate sky→grass→dirt→stone layers, with pixelated clouds and twinkling stars.
- **Animated Header**: Portal overlay animation opens with block ring explosion before revealing content.
- **Work Experience**: NES-style cards showing position, company, dates, summary, and expandable highlights powered by Framer Motion.
- **Projects Showcase**: Grid of project cards with fade-in, ‘Load More’ functionality, and animated reveal of tech tags.
- **Pixel Fonts & Icons**: Uses NES.css components and React Icons (FiChevronDown / FiChevronUp) for a cohesive 8-bit look.
- **Responsive & Accessible**: Mobile-first layout and ARIA-friendly semantics

## 🎨 Configuration

- **Project Data**: Edit `src/data/work.json`, `src/data/projects.json`, etc. to update your work history and open-source projects.
- **Type Definitions**: Found in `/types/*.ts` to keep data strongly typed.
- **Theme Colors**: Tailwind utilities and `.minecraft-world.day` / `.night` CSS classes in `globals.css` control sky gradients.
- **Toggle Button**: Customize the pixelated toggle in `ToggleDayNight.tsx`.

---

## 🚧 Customizing Animations

All animations use Framer Motion:

- **PortalOverlay**: Block ring explosion in `PortalOverlay.tsx`.
- **Clouds & Stars**: Day/Night sky animations in `MinecraftLayout.tsx`.
- **Card & List**: WorkExperience and Projects components leverage `AnimatePresence` and variants for smooth entry/exit and stagger effects.

Modify `variants` objects or transition props to fine-tune durations, easings, and staggering.
