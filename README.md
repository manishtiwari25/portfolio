## üé® Configuration

- **Project Data**: Edit `src/data/work.json`, `src/data/projects.json`, etc. to update your work history and open-source projects.
- **Type Definitions**: Found in `/types/*.ts` to keep data strongly typed.
- **Theme Colors**: Tailwind utilities and `.minecraft-world.day` / `.night` CSS classes in `globals.css` control sky gradients.
- **Toggle Button**: Customize the pixelated toggle in `ToggleDayNight.tsx`.

---

## üöß Customizing Animations

All animations use Framer Motion:

- **PortalOverlay**: Block ring explosion in `PortalOverlay.tsx`.
- **Clouds & Stars**: Day/Night sky animations in `MinecraftLayout.tsx`.
- **Card & List**: WorkExperience and Projects components leverage `AnimatePresence` and variants for smooth entry/exit and stagger effects.

Modify `variants` objects or transition props to fine-tune durations, easings, and staggering.
