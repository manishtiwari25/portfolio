## Coding Guidelines

- **Typescript**: Use strong typings; prefer `interface` for props and data shapes.
- **React Components**: Functional components with hooks; avoid class components.
- **Next.js**: Use the `app` router conventions and `use client` directives as needed.
- **CSS**: Tailwind utility classes and NES.css for styling; keep custom CSS minimal.

---

## Style & Formatting

- **Prettier**: Run `npm run format` or configure your editor to format on save.
- **ESLint**: Follow lint rules; run `npm run lint` regularly.
- **Commit Messages**: Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style.
